Delete your Linkedin Posts

Recently I decided to delete all my Linkedin posts, but all I could find was a way to unfollow people and bulk delete messages, not posts. [perhaps because MSFT owns Linkedin and also GitHub?]

unfollow people: https://mighil.com/mass-unfollow-people-on-linkedin/
delete messages: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-delete-multiple-linkedin-messages-hack-peter-abilla
delete messages: https://gist.github.com/twhitacre/d4536183c22a2f5a8c7c427df04acc90 (This was the basis for my hack below)
HOW TO USE THIS CODE TO REMOVE YOUR POSTS FROM LINKEDIN:
Step 1. Use Brave browser or Chrome (or enable developer options from Safari browser System Preferences)
Step 2. Login to your Linkedin account and go to your recent activity at this URL (replace the #USERNAME with your own): https://www.linkedin.com/in/#USERNAME/detail/recent-activity/shares/
Step 3. Then right click on the page and click "Inspect"
Step 4. Select "Console" and copy/paste the below script into the input area and hit Enter. Wait for all your posts to load.

var cnt=1; var interval = setInterval(clearFavs, 1500); function clearFavs() { cnt+=1; window.scrollTo(0,document.body.scrollHeight); }

Step 5. After you posts are all loaded, then enter this into Console and hit Enter:
for(var i = 1; i < 500; i++){ // just do it a bunch // Un retweet document.getElementsByClassName("react-button__trigger")[i].click(); }
